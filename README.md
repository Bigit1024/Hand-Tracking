# Hand-Tracking
Welcome to the Hand Tracking repository! This project leverages advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect and track hand movements in real time. It is implemented using two powerful Python packages: MediaPipe and OpenCV (cv2).

# Features:
- **Real-time Hand Detection:** Capture and track hand movements from a live video feed.
- **Landmark Detection:** Identify and highlight specific points on the hand, useful for gesture recognition.
- **Customizable:** Easily adjust parameters for detection sensitivity and tracking accuracy.

# Technologies Used:

## MediaPipe:
MediaPipe is a versatile machine learning pipeline framework developed by Google. It provides ready-to-use, customizable solutions for various computer vision tasks, including hand tracking. In this project, MediaPipe's hand tracking module is utilized to detect and track hand landmarks, offering high accuracy and efficiency. The module identifies 21 landmarks per hand, allowing for detailed analysis of hand poses and gestures.

## OpenCV (cv2):
OpenCV is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. It provides a wide range of tools for image and video processing. In this project, OpenCV is used for capturing video from the webcam, pre-processing images, and displaying the hand tracking results. It enables efficient handling of video streams and integration with MediaPipe's tracking capabilities.
